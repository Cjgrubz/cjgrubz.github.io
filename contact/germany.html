      <p>My first long trip overseas was around 1980. I, my mother, and grandmother went to Wiesbaden Germany to visit my godmother and godfather and cousins. I was like 9 years old. I remember it fondly. The flight was super long if I remember correctly it was a 13-hour flight. When we got to Germany I remember it was a lot different than the USA. It has an old world feel to it. The streets are still cobblestone and the background has many very old castles in it. While there we took a 3 day drive up the Rhine river I got to experience Germany in all its glory it was truly a magnificent country. We all went to France also and saw the Eifel tower it was a great experience.  </p>
