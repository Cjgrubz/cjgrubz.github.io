      <p>This is My Family and my spouse my better half as I like to call her and two of my kids. My wife is alicia she is a huge support for me always  behind me in my decisions. She is also the mother of my kids. I don't know what I woulkd do without her. Everyday I thank God for bringing her to me. My mom always raised us to understand that family is everything. As a child every holiday was spent with the majority of my entire family, and to this day I firmly believe that and live by this.</p>
