      <p>I am in the process of building app ideas with some colleagues. I can not divulge any info on my apps yet but as soon as we have it fully up and online I will be promoting it and I will keep my colleagues in the loop. This is not my only idea that I've had for apps, I can say this with all sincerity I had the whole idea for GrubHub before it was out. when I had the idea there was nothing out that had anything to do with that I I just did not have the skills to accomplish anything and when I started getting the skills to even begin it was too late GrubHub was already released. So I can say that if you have an idea for something try to make it a reality before someone else.</p>
